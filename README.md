# Crewmate-investigator

This is a program to assist you in your investigation to find the impostor(s).
Place the crewmates on the map where they are (or at least they said so...), and lead the investigation on the latest kill!

I made this program for myself, but if you have any suggestions you can open a issue.

Made with Qt 5.12.6

# TODO
